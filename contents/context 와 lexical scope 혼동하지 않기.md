In JavaScript, the scope refers to the current context of code execution. It determines the visibility and accessibility of variables, functions, and objects. There are two types of scope: global scope and local scope.

On the other hand, "context" refers to the value of the `this` keyword in a given function. The context is determined at runtime and it depends on how the function was invoked. The `this` keyword refers to the object that the function is a method of, or to the global object if the function is not a method of an object.

The difference between lexical scope and context is that lexical scope is determined at the time the code is written and it is based on the structure of the code, while context is determined at runtime and it is based on how the function is invoked.
